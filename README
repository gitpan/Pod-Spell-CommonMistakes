NAME
    Pod::Spell::CommonMistakes - Catches common typos in POD

SYNOPSIS
            #!/usr/bin/perl
            use strict; use warnings;

            use Pod::Spell::CommonMistakes qw( check_pod );

            my $file = $ARGV[0] || 'lib/Pod/Spell/CommonMistakes.pm';
            my $result = check_pod( $file );
            if ( keys %$result == 0 ) {
                    print "File passed tests!\n";
            } else {
                    print "File failed tests!\n";
                    foreach my $k ( keys %$result ) {
                            print " Found: '$k' - Possible spelling: '$result->{$k}'?\n";
                    }
            }

DESCRIPTION
    This module looks for any typos in your POD. It differs from Pod::Spell
    or Test::Spelling because it uses a custom wordlist and doesn't use the
    system spellchecker. The idea for this came from the
    <http://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Lintian> code in Debian, thanks!

    To use this, just pass it a filename that has POD in it and you'll get a
    hashref back. If the hashref is empty that means the checker found no
    misspelled words. If it contains keys, then the keys are the bad words
    and the values are the suggested spelling.

Methods
  check_pod( $filename )
    This function is what you will usually run. It will run the spell checks
    against the POD in $filename. Warning: you would need to catch any
    exceptions thrown from this function!

    It returns a hashref of misspelled words and their suggested spelling.
    If the hash is empty then there is no errors in the POD.

  check_pod_case( $filename )
    This function behaves the same as check_pod() but it uses a "strict"
    wordlist instead. The difference is that this wordlist will make sure
    you capitalize common terms properly. One example is: OpenLdap =>
    OpenLDAP.

    NOTE: This does NOT run the same checks as check_pod()! If you want to
    check both the regular and picky wordlists, you would need to use the
    check_pod_all() function.

  check_pod_all( $filename )
    This function behaves the same as check_pod() but it runs all the extra
    checks too. Currently it's just the picky wordlist but others might be
    added in the future...

EXPORT
    You would need to manually get the function you want.
